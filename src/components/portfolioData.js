        description: "Moiveo is strictly for the movie/tv-show lovers. Moiveo relies heavily on the TMDB API. It showcases my ability to work deeply with data from an APIâ€”fetching, manipulating, and displaying it dynamically on the UI. I focused on crafting a fully responsive design, making sure the UI adapts smoothly to any screen size. I used Redux Toolkit for efficient state management, ensuring seamless data flow across the application. React Router came in handy for seamless navigation.",
